        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a clam chowder recipe that goes well with sourdough bread.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>5 unpeeled potatoes, diced</li>
            <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams with juice</li>
            <li>2 (1.8 ounce) packages dry leek soup mix</li>
            <li>1 quart half-and-half</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the bacon in a large pot and cook over medium-high heat, stir occasionally, until crip and browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon, leaving the drippings in the pot. Set the bacon aside.</li>
            <li>Stir the potatoes and carrots into the bacon fat. Season with salt and pepper, and cook for 5 minutes, stir frequently.</li>
            <li>Pour the juice from the clams into the pot, and add enough water to just cover the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Bring the potatoes to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gently stir the leek soup mix into the potatoes until no lumps of soup remain.</li>
            <li>Stir in the clams, reserved bacon, and half-and-half cream.</li>
            <li>Cook and stir until the chowder returns to a simmer and thickens, about 10 minutes more.</li>
        </ol>
